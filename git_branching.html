    <ul>
        <li>What git command creates a branch? <b>git checkout -b</b></li>
           <li> What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge? <b>FF merges take place if no commits have occurred on original branch while new branch is being worked on</b></li>
            <li>What git command changes to another branch? <b>git checkout</b></li>
            <li>What git command deletes a branch? <b>git branch -d [NAME-OF-BRANCH]</b></li>
            <li>How do merge conflicts happen? <b>changes are committed to the same file on two different branches--git says, "what version should I use?" -- can't have two files with different contents but the same name </b></li>
    </ul>
